      <h2>Verse 1</h2> <!-- Title -->
        <p> Take me out tonight. <!-- Start of Verse 1 -->
            Where there's music and there's people
            and they're young and alive.
          <br>Driving in your car. <!-- Line break to make reading easier when viewing. -->
            I never, never want to go home
            because I haven't got one anymore.
           <br>Take me out tonight <!-- Line Break -->
            because I want to see people
            and I want to see life.
            <br>Driving in your car. <!-- Line Break -->
            Oh please, don't drop me home
            because it's not my home, it's their home
            and I'm welcome no more.</p> <!-- End of Verse 1 -->

        <p>And if a double-decker bus <!-- Start of first chorus -->
            crashes into us.
            To die by your side
            is such a heavenly way to die.
           <br> And if a ten tonne truck <!-- Line Break -->
            kills the both of us.
            To die by your side
            well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine.</p> <!-- End of Chorus -->

        <p>Take me out tonight <!-- Start of Verse 2 -->
            take me anywhere
            I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
           <br> And in the darkened underpass <!-- Line Break -->
            I thought, 'Oh God, my chance has come at last!'
            But then a strange fear gripped me
            and I just couldn't ask.
           <br> Take me out tonight <!-- Line Break -->
            oh take me anywhere
            I don't care, I don't care, I don't care.
          <br>  Driving in your car <!-- Line Break -->
            I never, never want to go home
            because I haven't got one
            oh, I haven't got one.</p> <!-- End of Verse 2 -->
